# 🌐 System Overview

This page is a web application designed to manage the entire lifecycle of technical incidents. It allows users to report issues, technicians to resolve them, and moderators to administer the system.

## 👥 User Roles

There are three types of users, each with specific responsibilities:

- Users can report technical problems and check the status of their own reports.

- Technicians can see the problems assigned to them, add notes about what they've done, and mark issues as resolved.

- Moderators are in charge of the entire system. They can assign tasks, manage departments and categories, and view usage statistics.

## 📂 Navigating the System

The application has a top navigation bar that changes depending on your role. For example, a user will see options to report a problem, while a technician will see tools to manage their assigned tasks.

## 🛠️ Managing Incidents
Users can create a new incident by filling out a simple form with a description, the department it belongs to, and the date it happened. Once submitted, technicians and moderators can view the report. Moderators can also edit the details later if needed.

## 🔍 Tracking Actions
Technicians can record what work they’ve done on each incident, so there is a clear history of how the issue was handled. This helps keep everything transparent and organized.

## 📊 Moderator Tools
Moderators have access to a special dashboard where they can control all aspects of the system. They can assign incidents to technicians, manage different departments and problem categories, and view real-time statistics about the system’s usage.

## 🗃️ Managing Reference Data
Moderators can add and edit department names, locations, categories of problems, and technician accounts. They can also remove technician accounts when they are no longer needed.

## 📋 Logging and Security
The system automatically keeps track of user actions for security and auditing purposes. This helps ensure that everything is properly recorded and traceable.

## 🔐 Default Accounts
To help you get started quickly, the system comes with a few default users:

- User: user / 12345
- Moderator: admin / 12345
- Technicians: Several test accounts, all with password 12345

## 🎨 Theme Options
The application supports both light mode and dark mode. You can switch between them using the theme button in the top menu, depending on what’s more comfortable for your eyes.
